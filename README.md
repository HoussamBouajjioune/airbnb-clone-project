### Importance of User-Friendly Design

A user-friendly design is essential for a successful booking platform. It reduces friction throughout the user journey, enhances user satisfaction, and boosts conversion rates. Clear navigation, fast-loading components, and intuitive interactions make it easier for users to find and book properties. A clean and responsive interface encourages trust and keeps users engaged, especially on mobile devices where most users browse and book accommodations.

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Identifying design properties such as colors, typography, and spacing is critical when translating a Figma mockup into a live application. These properties ensure **visual consistency**, reinforce **brand identity**, and contribute to **usability and accessibility**. By adhering to predefined styles, developers and designers maintain a shared understanding, reduce guesswork, and speed up implementation while ensuring a cohesive user experience across all screens and devices.

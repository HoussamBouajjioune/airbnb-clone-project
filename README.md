- Prioritize mobile responsiveness for accessibility on all devices

### Key Features

- Property search and filtering functionality
- Detailed property viewing with image gallery and amenities
- Secure checkout process with booking confirmation
- User authentication and account management

### Primary Pages

| Page Name               | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View   | Grid display of available properties with filtering options by location, price, etc. |
| Listing Detailed View   | Full details of a selected property including images, amenities, location map, and a booking form |

### üîç Importance of Identifying Design Properties

Comprendre les propri√©t√©s de design, telles que les couleurs et la typographie, est essentiel pour garantir la coh√©rence visuelle et l'identit√© de la marque. Ces √©l√©ments facilitent la collaboration entre les concepteurs et les d√©veloppeurs, assurent une hi√©rarchie visuelle claire et am√©liorent l'exp√©rience utilisateur globale. De plus, une identification pr√©cise permet une impl√©mentation efficace dans le code, r√©duisant ainsi les erreurs et les incoh√©rences.
